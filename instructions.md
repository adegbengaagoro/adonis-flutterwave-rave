## Registering provider

Like any other provider, you need to register the provider inside `start/app.js` file.

```js
const providers = [
  'adonisjs-flutterwave-rave/providers/FlutterwaveRaveProvider'
]
```

## Config

The configuration is saved inside `config/ravepay.js` file. Tweak it accordingly.
